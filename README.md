# Lexical-complexity
Code for dissertation work focused on analyzing L2 Spanish lexical complexity

This is a beginner's guide to calculating lexical diversity, density, and sophistication in Spanish writing and/or speech using Python and SpaCy. I give very detailed explanations about how everything works. Feel free to email me if you have any questions about it. I hope it can serve as a resource for other language researchers.
